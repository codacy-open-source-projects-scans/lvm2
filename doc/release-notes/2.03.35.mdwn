Features
-----------------------

### Optimize dmeventd when remonitoring active devices.

Add grace period (controlled by `-g SECONDS` option) to [dmeventd(8)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/dmeventd.8.html) to reuse threads.

This change help to reduce overhead and unnecessary `lvextend` calls.


<!--
TODO: It would be nice if we could use a real session output, so we could test the examples
- During tests, save some outputs
-->

Changes in command line
-----------------------

* Report options (`--select STRING`, `--configreport CONFIG_REPORT`, `--logonly`)
  are allowed only with `(pv|vg|lv)display -C|--columns`.
  These **no longer work** without `-C|--columns` and were removed as they were not working properly anyway.

Other Changes
-------------

* Fix unlocking devices file only after all PVs are processed.
* Avoid creating system.devices when deleting entries.
* Fix existing issues with persistent reservations.
* Fix possible report output format inconsistencies while processing PVs.
* Allow report options for pv/vg/lvdisplay only if used with -C|--columns.
* Fix vgsplit failing to split a VG with RAID+integrity or cache with cachevol.
* Fix --lockopt handling in lvmlockd when --nolocking is used.
* Optimize dmeventd when remonitoring active devices.
