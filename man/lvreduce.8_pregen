.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
lvreduce reduces the size of an LV. The freed logical extents are returned
to the VG to be used by other LVs. A copy-on-write snapshot LV can also
be reduced if less space is needed to hold COW blocks. Use
\fBlvconvert\fP(8) to change the number of data images in a RAID or
mirrored LV.
.P
Be careful when reducing an LV's size, because data in the reduced area is
lost. Ensure that any file system on the LV is resized \fBbefore\fP
running lvreduce so that the removed extents are not in use by the file
system.
.P
Sizes will be rounded if necessary. For example, the LV size must be an
exact number of extents, and the size of a striped segment must be a
multiple of the number of stripes.
.P
In the usage section below, \fB--size\fP \fISize\fP can be replaced
with \fB--extents\fP \fINumber\fP.  See both descriptions
the options section.

.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.O_autobackup
Specifies if metadata should be backed up automatically after a change.
Enabling this is strongly advised!
See \fBvgcfgbackup\fP(8) for more information.
.
.TP
.O_commandprofile
The command profile to use for command configuration.
See \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more information about profiles.
.
.TP
.O_config
Config settings for the command. These override \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) settings.
The String arg uses the same format as \fBlvm.conf\fP(5),
or may use section/field syntax.
See \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) for more information about config.
.
.TP
.O_debug
Set debug level. Repeat from 1 to 6 times to increase the detail of
messages sent to the log file and/or syslog (if configured).
.
.TP
.O_devices
Restricts the devices that are visible and accessible to the command.
Devices not listed will appear to be missing. This option can be
repeated, or accepts a comma separated list of devices. This overrides
the devices file.
.
.TP
.O_devicesfile
A file listing devices that LVM should use.
The file must exist in \fI#DEFAULT_SYS_DIR#/devices/\fP and is managed
with the \fBlvmdevices\fP(8) command.
This overrides the \fBlvm.conf\fP(5) \fBdevices/devicesfile\fP and
\fBdevices/use_devicesfile\fP settings.
.
.TP
.O_driverloaded
If set to no, the command will not attempt to use device-mapper.
For testing and debugging.
.
.TP
.O_extents
Specifies the new size of the LV in logical extents.
The --size and --extents options are alternate methods of specifying size.
The total number of physical extents used will be
greater when redundant data is needed for RAID levels.
An alternate syntax allows the size to be determined indirectly
as a percentage of the size of a related VG, LV, or set of PVs. The
suffix \fB%VG\fP denotes the total size of the VG, the suffix \fB%FREE\fP
the remaining free space in the VG, and the suffix \fB%PVS\fP the free
space in the specified PVs.  For a snapshot, the size
can be expressed as a percentage of the total size of the origin LV
with the suffix \fB%ORIGIN\fP (\fB100%ORIGIN\fP provides space for
the whole origin).
When expressed as a percentage, the size defines an upper limit for the
number of logical extents in the new LV. The precise number of logical
extents in the new LV is not determined until the command has completed.
When the plus \fB+\fP or minus \fB-\fP prefix is used,
the value is not an absolute size, but is relative and added or subtracted
from the current size.
.
.TP
.O_force
Override various checks, confirmations and protections.
Use with extreme caution.
.
.TP
.O_fs
Control file system resizing when resizing an LV.
\fBchecksize\fP: Check the fs size and reduce the LV if the fs is not
using the reduced space (fs reduce is not needed.) If the reduced space
is used by the fs, then do not resize the fs or LV, and return an error.
(checksize only applies when reducing, and does nothing for extend.)
\fBresize\fP: Resize the fs by calling the fs-specific resize command.
This may also include mounting, unmounting, or running fsck. See --fsmode to
control mounting behavior, and --nofsck to disable fsck.
\fBresize_fsadm\fP: Use the old method of calling fsadm to handle the fs
(deprecated.) Warning: this option does not prevent lvreduce from destroying
file systems that are unmounted (or mounted if prompts are skipped.)
\fBignore\fP: Resize the LV without checking for or handling a file system.
Warning: using ignore when reducing the LV size may destroy the file system.
.sp
Note: If resizing an LV without a file system and the new LV size matches
the existing size, the command returns a \fBnon-zero status code\fP (failure).
However, if a file system resize is also requested along with the LV resize,
and the sizes already match, the command returns a \fBzero status code\fP
(success). This occurs because the external commands called to resize the file
system return success even if the new and old file system sizes are identical.
LVM follows the command status code behavior in this scenario.
.
.TP
.O_fsmode
Control file system mounting behavior for fs resize.
\fBmanage\fP: Mount or unmount the fs as needed to resize the fs,
and attempt to restore the original mount state at the end.
\fBnochange\fP: Do not mount or unmount the fs. If mounting or unmounting
is required to resize the fs, then do not resize the fs or the LV and fail
the command.
\fBoffline\fP: Unmount the fs if it is mounted, and resize the fs while it
is unmounted. If mounting is required to resize the fs, then do not resize
the fs or the LV and fail the command.
.
.TP
.O_help
Display help text.
.
.TP
.O_journal
Record information in the systemd journal.
This information is in addition to information
enabled by the lvm.conf log/journal setting.
command: record information about the command.
output: record the default command output.
debug: record full command debugging.
.
.TP
.O_lockopt
Used to pass options for special cases to lvmlockd.
See \fBlvmlockd\fP(8) for more information.
.
.TP
.O_longhelp
Display long help text.
.
.TP
.O_nofsck
Do not perform fsck when resizing the file system with --resizefs.
.
.TP
.O_nohints
Do not use the hints file to locate devices for PVs. A command may read
more devices to find PVs when hints are not used. The command will still
perform standard hint file invalidation where appropriate.
.
.TP
.O_nolocking
Disable locking. Use with caution, concurrent commands may produce
incorrect results.
.
.TP
.O_noudevsync
Disables udev synchronization. The process will not wait for notification
from udev. It will continue irrespective of any possible udev processing
in the background. Only use this if udev is not running or has rules that
ignore the devices LVM creates.
.
.TP
.O_profile
An alias for --commandprofile or --metadataprofile, depending
on the command.
.
.TP
.O_quiet
Suppress output and log messages. Overrides --debug and --verbose.
Repeat once to also suppress any prompts with answer 'no'.
.
.TP
.O_reportformat
Overrides current output format for reports which is defined globally by
the report/output_format setting in \fBlvm.conf\fP(5).
\fBbasic\fP is the original format with columns and rows.
If there is more than one report per command, each report is prefixed
with the report name for identification. \fBjson\fP produces report
output in JSON format. \fBjson_std\fP produces report output in
JSON format which is more compliant with JSON standard.
See \fBlvmreport\fP(7) for more information.
.
.TP
.O_resizefs
Resize the fs using the fs-specific resize command.
May include mounting, unmounting, or running fsck. See --fsmode to control
mounting behavior, and --nofsck to disable fsck. See --fs for more options
(--resizefs is equivalent to --fs resize.)
.
.TP
.O_size
Specifies the new size of the LV.
The --size and --extents options are alternate methods of specifying size.
The total number of physical extents used will be
greater when redundant data is needed for RAID levels.
When the plus \fB+\fP or minus \fB-\fP prefix is used,
the value is not an absolute size, but is relative and added or subtracted
from the current size.
.
.TP
.O_test
Run in test mode. Commands will not update metadata.
This is implemented by disabling all metadata writing but nevertheless
returning success to the calling function. This may lead to unusual
error messages in multi-stage operations if a tool relies on reading
back metadata it believes has changed but hasn't.
.
.TP
.O_verbose
Set verbose level. Repeat from 1 to 4 times to increase the detail
of messages sent to stdout and stderr.
.
.TP
.O_version
Display version information.
.
.TP
.O_yes
Do not prompt for confirmation interactively but always assume the
answer yes. Use with extreme caution.
(For automatic no, see -qq.)
.
.SH VARIABLES
.
.TP
.I LV
Logical Volume name.  See \fBlvm\fP(8) for valid names.
An LV positional arg generally includes the VG name and LV name, e.g. VG/LV.
.
.TP
.I String
See the option description for information about the string content.
.
.TP
.IR Size [UNIT]
Size is an input number that accepts an optional unit.
Input units are always treated as base two values, regardless of
capitalization, e.g. 'k' and 'K' both refer to 1024.
The default input unit is specified by letter, followed by |UNIT.
UNIT represents other possible input units:
.BR b | B
is bytes,
.BR s | S
is sectors of 512 bytes,
.BR k | K
is KiB,
.BR m | M
is MiB,
.BR g | G
is GiB,
.BR t | T
is TiB,
.BR p | P
is PiB,
.BR e | E
is EiB.
(This should not be confused with the output control --units,
where capital letters mean multiple of 1000.)
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.
See \fBlvm\fP(8) for information about environment variables used by lvm.
For example, \fBLVM_VG_NAME\fP can generally be substituted
for a required VG parameter.
